This large-scale experiment was conducted in collabo- ration with citizen scientists from the 4H Federation of Finland, a youth organization with 79000 members distributed across the Finnish countryside.","For the time question, they sampled multiple points (days) over the course of the experiment - 6 sample points in 60 days. They were trying to tease apart taxon-specific effects. Interesting: The current observations of the impact of dor beetles offer large-scale proof for previous findings obtained at smaller spatial scales: that dung beetle species of high body mass may be disproportionately important for sustaining an overall ecosystem service in both temper- ate (Rosenlew and Roslin 2008) and tropical regions (Larsen et al. 2005, Slade et al. 2007, 2011). The fate of a major ecosystem service may then hinge disproportion- ately on the fate of individual, large-sized species—a finding with profound consequences for conservation priorities. Overall, we note that our general approach of estimating functional contributions of decomposer taxa as differences in mass among dung pats to which they had vs. lacked access relies on the explicit assumption that relevant taxa were present across sites. For pat- dwelling dung beetles in the genus Aphodius, this assumption was verified through direct sampling of five bait pats (see above and Appendix B). For earthworms and dor beetles, the sampling techniques employed will suffice to establish neither their presence nor their abundance. ****FLAG AS AN INNOVATIVE APPROACH TO SCALE UP ES RESEARCH - citizen science experiments *****","decomposers and different treatments of them. xperimental treatments were implemented: (1) cow pats exposed to all local decomposers, (2) pats from which the burying activity of dor beetles (genus Geotropes) was blocked, (3) pats from which dor beetles were completely excluded, (4) pats from which both dor beetles and earthworms were excluded, and5) pats from which all local decomposers were excluded.",0,dung decomposition,1,Service Provider (Q17),TRUE,"Aphodius beetles, earthworms","Multiple ESP species [e.g., multiple focal ESP species]",0,0,Other,FALSE,rainfall,0,No,Yes,,FALSE,
